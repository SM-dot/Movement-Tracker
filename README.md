# Team Exer-vibes - Wearable Fitness Device

## Project Overview

Team Exer-vibes dedicated the entire quarter to the development of a wearable fitness device aimed at accurately tracking users' steps and staircase activity. The project not only involved the creation of a physical device but also an engaging mobile app to help users monitor their progress and set step count goals. The team operated within a budget constraint of $150, utilizing a combination of hardware components, including accelerometers, barometers, vibration motors, and specific Arduino devices such as UNO, Bluno, and Beetle.

## Key Features

- Accurate step counting and staircase activity tracking.
- User-friendly mobile app for progress monitoring and goal setting.
- Hardware components: accelerometer, barometer, vibration motor, UNO, Bluno, Beetle.
- Budget constraint: $150.

## Technologies Used

1. **SOLIDWORKS**: Used for designing a suitable structure to house the electrical components.
2. **Arduino Language**: Algorithms were written in Arduino to manipulate data from sensors.
3. **Circuit Design**: Mapped out the circuitry and performed soldering in the lab.
4. **Blynk**: Utilized for creating a user-friendly mobile app.

## Project Challenges and Learnings

The development process presented several challenges, including budget constraints, hardware integration, and software development. However, these challenges provided valuable learning opportunities for the team. Overcoming these hurdles enhanced our problem-solving skills and deepened our understanding of both hardware and software aspects of the project.
